# openmidi
OpenMIDI is a community driven effort to document the MIDI implementations of various MIDI devices for the benefit of all musicians. It aims to be the source of truth and reference via community feedback and contribution. 

This information is made available at www.openmidi.com or in this repository for public use. 

OpenMIDI is hosted free of charge by [Morningstar Engineering](https://www.morningstar.io)

# Instructions
The MIDI data for each device is saved in [yaml](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) files. 

The yaml files are organized in folders `data > brands`

Each yaml file follows a template (see template below)

After a new yaml file is created, the `mapping.json` file needs to be updated to map the brand and product name to the new file.
