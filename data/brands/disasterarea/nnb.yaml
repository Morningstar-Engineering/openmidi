    Power the NNB using the CAT5 or USB cable. Wait until the LED
    starts flashing, then hold the switch to enter the config mode. 
    Send a MIDI program change message from your controller on the channel you wish to use.
    The NNB will set itself to that channel and save the setting. 
    Unplug the NNB to restart.

    PC  | Effect    | Preset
    ----------------------------------------
    0   | No Change | Sets left knob to zero
    1   | White     | Yellow
    2   | White     | Violet
    3   | Blue      | Yellow
    4   | Blue      | Violet
    5   | Green     | Yellow
    6   | Green     | Violet
    7   | Red       | Yellow
    8   | Red       | Violet

    Please note that sending MIDI Program 0 (zero) does not change the effect or preset option, but rather sets the left knob (Mix) to its minimum position.
    This allows for a type of “bypass” even though the Expanse pedals do not support an actual bypass command.
