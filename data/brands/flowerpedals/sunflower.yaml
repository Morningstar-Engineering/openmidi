  - name: Ramp Mode
    value: '27'
    description: 0-42 for latching ramp mode, where a single tap to the Tap/Ramp switch
      will trigger a ramp to either the primary or secondary speed. 43-85 for momentary
      ramp mode, where holding down the Tap/Ramp switch will ramp the speed from the
      primary to the secondary speed and then when the switch is released, the speed
      will ramp from the secondary speed back to the primary speed. 86-127 for drift
      mode, where the speed of the tremolo automatically drifts up and down around the
      primary speed according to the selected Drift Speed, Drift Depth, and Drift Shape
      settings.
