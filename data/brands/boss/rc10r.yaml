    The RC-10R ships with the default MIDI control channel of 1 and a Note channel of 10. 
    The note channel is for playing the drum sounds via MIDI. 
    MIDI CC commands are OFF by default. You need to program the unit with the CC per command. The CC numbers below are just suggestions. CC can be 1-31 and 64-95.
    In other words, if you just send the commands below nothing will happen. You need to set the CC value for each command on the RC-10R. 
    MIDI note mapping is found on the last page of the RC-10R MIDI implimentation guide.

    MIDI CCs on the RC-10R are all customizable, so the MIDI mappings here are just a suggestion. The RC-10R ships with no default MIDI CCs.
    You can go into the MIDI menu on the RC-10R to link each CC to a desired function (e.g. LOOP START).
    Furthermore, for command-style functions (like start and stop), the RC-10R treats each CC as a footswitch, where 127 = footswitch down and 0 = footswitch up.
    To execute these commands, you need to send two messages: 1. CC with value = 127; 2. CC with value = 0.
    CCs that control numerical parameters (like Loop Level, Total Level, etc.) only need one message.
