    The RC-10R ships with the default MIDI control channel of 1 and a Note channel of 10. 
    The note channel is for playing the drum sounds via MIDI. 
    MIDI CC commands are OFF by default. You need to program the unit with the CC per command. The CC numbers below are just suggestions. CC can be 1-31 and 64-95.
    In other words, if you just send the commands below nothing will happen. You need to set the CC value for each command on the RC-10R. 
    MIDI note mapping is found on the last page the RC-10R MIDI implimentation guide.
