      Set the NRPN LSB for Mix control

      We use the “NRPN Register” (Non-Registered Parameter Number) which is a
      general purpose MSB (CC:99) and LSB (CC:98). All that means is that you can control
      multiple parameters on the BeatBuddy using an MSB sequence, which is usually a
      series of 3 commands: 2 CC commands and one PC.

      This can be used to control tempo, any other parameter, or multiple parameters at
      once. Currently we’re only using it to control tempo, but we follow the MIDI
      Standard protocol to leave room for further control in the future.

      Optional if the only value control by Inc/Dec is the Tempo. By
      default, the Beatbuddy will increment / decrement the tempo when receiving a INC/
      DEC message.

      Set the Tempo MSB

      In order to directly set the tempo to a specific BPM, you need to use the Tempo MSB and Tempo LSB. The Beatbuddy will update its current tempo only when receiving the LSB message.
      - So the order of the message should be:
        1. MSB value
        2. LSB value
      -  Don’t forget, the value of the Tempo can only be set with both MSB(CC:106) and LSB (CC:107).

      The BeatBuddy's tempo range is from 40-300BPM
