    Sysex Info:

    Start (Sysex Real Time)	- Starts the Aeros depending on the MIDI Start setting. If the part is empty and MIDI Start is set to record, the Aeros will
    record on the first track. If the song part is empty and the MIDI Start setting is set to only playback, the Aeros will enter a 'scrolling' mode in the empty part.

    Stop (Sysex Real Time) - Stops playback immediately

    Time Signature:	- Time Signature is sent by BeatBuddy whenever a song is loaded as a Sysex midi message and repeatedly every 3 seconds. The Aeros will set it's own internal time signature when receiving these commands if the song is empty.

    The Aeros can open any song using a combination of MSB and PC commands.  Added in 4.1.2

    MSB value 0-127
    PC value 0-12

    Pay close attention this is a brain twister: MSB stands for Most Significant Bit, it is a concept used in MIDI that allows a user to do all sorts of things like change parameters, change banks, and—in the Aeros' case—song select .

    MSB is not a traditional MIDI command, it is actually activated by using a CC:0 (Control Change) command, the value decides which MSB bank is chosen. So, CC:0 value 4 represents MSB bank 4.

    PC (Program Change) is another type of MIDI command typically used in conjunction with MSB and/or LSB commands. LSB (Least Significant Bit; CC:32 values 0-127) is not relevant to the Aeros, but is relevant to the BeatBuddy's song select scheme. It is often also used without an MSB (CC:0) and/or LSB (CC:32) command, but that is not the case for the Aeros.

    The Aeros requires the user to send an MSB + and a PC command—in that order—to open a song.

    First, the user must open the song, and edit the song. Then, you will find the MIDI song Select enabled setting. Once enabled, the user can set which MSB (0-127) bank and which PC command will be required to open the song.

    Then, using a MIDI controller capable of sending CC:0 (MSB) + PC commands in a sequence, you can open that song at any time.

    KNOWN BUG v4.1.2: Aeros is currently not responding to commands sent in the Home Screen before a song has been opened, you must open a song before the Aeros can register the commands and open a song via MIDI select.
