    By default, the PROFILER receives MIDI commands on all sixteen MIDI channels (“Omni”). However, if you want to control multiple devices independently, you can set a specific channel in System Settings on the “MIDI Settings” page. Now, the PROFILER will only receive messages on that channel.

    Performance Mode:
    There are 128 program changes available in MIDI and these are assigned to each Slot as they occur within the Performances, in linear fashion:

    Rig in Performance 1, Slot 1 loaded by program change 0
    Rig in Performance 1, Slot 2 loaded by program change 1
    ...
    Rig in Performance 2, Slot 5 loaded by program change 9
    ...
    Rig in Performance 26, Slot 3 loaded by program change 127

    You could also use the following formula: (#Performance * 5) - 5 + (#Slot - 1)

    Due to the limit of 128 different program change values you can only address about 25 Performances. If you need more, you must use the MIDI bank select controllers which allow you to address multiple pages of 128 program changes each.

    Instead of calculating the appropriate MIDI bank select, LSB and program change, you could simply read it from the screen. If no PROFILER Remote is connected, both items are displayed for the current Slot on the left-hand side of the home screen in Performance Mode.

    While program changes are required to initiate the Rig load, bank select MSB and LSB are redundant. You don’t need to send bank select MSB because Performance Mode always assumes value “0”. Bank select LSB is not required if you navigate within the same MIDI bank.

    These two MIDI control change numbers are associated with MIDI bank select: #0 Bank select MSB (always 0), #32 Bank select LSB (values 0-4).

    Browser Mode:
    You can assign up to 128 MIDI program change numbers to Rigs in your browse pool. These assignments are set in the System Settings on page “Browser Mode PrgChg”.

    To assign a program change number to a Rig, first load the Rig in the Browser Mode. Then press the SYSTEM button. Navigate to the page “Browser Mode PrgChg” using the PAGE buttons.

    Select a desired program change number using soft knob “MIDI PrgChg#” and then press the soft button “Assign”. Use the soft button labeled “Unassign” to erase assignments.

    Without leaving this page you can use the RIG navigation cross to load other Rigs from your browse pool and perform more assignments.

    Instead of using MIDI program changes, you can use control changes (#48-54) to load Slots in Performance Mode and Rigs in Browser Mode.
