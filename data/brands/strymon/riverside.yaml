    Riverside contains 300 preset locations, numbered sequentially from
    0-299. Because MIDI Program Change messages have a maximum
    number of 128 (0-127) the presets are grouped into three MIDI patch
    banks.
    - MIDI BANK 0 = PRESETS 0-127
    - MIDI BANK 1 = PRESETS 128-255
    - MIDI BANK 2 = PRESETS 256-299
    Riverside always powers up in MIDI Patch Bank 0, so if you plan to
    stay within the first 127 presets, simply send a standard MIDI Program
    Change message to load a preset.
    If you will be using MIDI Banks 1 and/or 2, it is advisable to send a
    standard MIDI Bank Change message “MIDI CC# 0 with a value equal
    to the MIDI Bank#” before each MIDI Program Change.
    Selecting bank 0, patch 127 will put Riverside into Manual mode. In this
    mode, the pedal will be set to the current knob and switch settings. No
    preset data can be stored at this preset location.
