    Your cloudburst pedal contains 300 preset locations, numbered
    sequentially from 0-299. Because MIDI Program Change messages have
    a maximum number of 128 (0-127), the presets are grouped into three
    MIDI patch banks
    MIDI BANK 0 = PRESETS 0-127
    MIDI BANK 1 = PRESETS 128-255
    MIDI BANK 2 = PRESETS 256-299
