    description: |
      The Color knob controls the preamplifier gain and output level in tandem. This allows the user to overload the preamp and delay line elements while maintaining a consistent output volume level. This knob has three effective regions. In the first region of its rotation, the preamp adds a subtle warming effect. In the second region, the delay line begins to overload gracefully while the dry signal remains relatively clean. In the third region, both the delay
      5
      line and the preamp will overload with a full-bodied and clear overdrive texture. The exact onset of clipping will depend on the strength of the input signal. Note that when in Trails bypass mode, the preamp is still active. This means you can use the Color knob on its own when the delay is off. Secondary function: Volume Trim. Use this setting to adjust the output level, from -6dB to +6dB. At halfway the volume is even with the bypass level.

  - name: Mix
    value: '13'
    description: This control sets the mix of dry and delayed signals, with two operational
      modes. In the default PAN mode, the Mix knob functions as a crossfader. Turning
      clockwise increases the level of delayed signal while decreasing the level of
      the unaffected signal, or vice versa. This mode is more commonly found in rackmount
      or desktop processors, and is handy if you use a parallel effects loop. In NORM
      mode, the dry level is fixed and the Mix knob only affects the delay level. This
      behavior is similar to a traditional stompbox.

  - name: Feedback
    value: '14'
    description: This knob sets the number of repeats by controlling how much of the
      delayed signal is fed back into the input. The taper is optimized to easily dial
      in an infinite bed of echoes at the threshold of self-oscillation but, of course,
      also capable of achieving runaway feedback and self-oscillation.

  - name: Filter
    value: '15'
    description: 'This controls a dual mode filter located at the output of the delay
      line. Changing the tone of the delay changes how the repeats evolve over time.
      At the center position, the filter is effectively out of the circuit. Clockwise
      from center engages a high pass filter and increases its cutoff frequency to attenuate
      bass frequencies so that each repeat becomes successively brighter. Rotating counter-clockwise
      from center engages a low pass filter and decreases its cutoff frequency to attenuate
      treble frequencies for a murky sound where each repeat gets successively darker. '
