      0 - 63: your signal strength causes the LFO to go faster or slower
      (depending

      on the Rate setting) with increasing intensity. 

      64: no dynamics are engaged. 

      65 - 127: a dynamic element is introduced to

      the reverb, where only signals above a certain threshold are let in, and
      while those signals are

      let in, the decay of the reverb is decreased as well to clear out existing
      trail
