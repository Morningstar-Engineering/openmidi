    Wraped Vinyl HiFi is set to MIDI channel 6 by default, but it is easy to change if you need to.

    If you want to change it, simply hold down both stomp switches when you provide power to the pedal
    (hold down both stomp switches simultaneously) and then you can let go.
    The pedal is now looking for the first “Program Change” message it sees, and it will set itself to whatever channel
    it gets that first message from, permanently (until you change it again, of course).

    RECALLING A PRESET VIA MIDI

    You can activate a preset by sending a MIDI Program Change message. For example, sending a Program Change message
    of 1 activates preset 1. There are 122 total preset slots available. Slots 1 and 2 are the presets that can be saved
    and activateddirectly from the pedal via the preset toggle. Slot 1 is the right slot. Slot 2 is the left slot.

    Sending a Program Change message of 0 puts the pedal in “Live” mode which is identical to when the preset toggle
    switch is in the middle position, in normal pedal operation.

    If you do not save something into presets 3 through 122, nothing will be recalled. There are no factory presets
    besides the two that come loaded in slots 1 and 2. The idea is for you to create your own.

    SAVING A PRESET VIA MIDI

    You save a preset by sending a MIDI Program Change message while holding down both stomp switches. For example,
    sending a Program Change message of 45 while holding down both stomp switches will save your current settings to
    preset 45. There are 122 total slots. Slots 1 and 2 are the presets that can be saved and activated directly from
    the pedal via the preset toggle. Slot 1 is the right slot. Slot 2 is the left slot.
